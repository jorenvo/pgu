#PURPOSE:  Program to illustrate how functions work
#          This program will compute the value of
#          2^3 + 5^2
#
#Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
#so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.

#PURPOSE:  This function is used to compute
#          the value of a number raised to
#          a power.
#
#INPUT:    First argument - the base number
#          Second argument - the power to
#                            raise it to
#
#OUTPUT:   Will give the result as a return value
#
#NOTES:    The power must be 1 or greater
#
#VARIABLES:
#          %rbx - holds the base number
#          %rcx - holds the power
#          -4(%rbp) - holds the current result
#          %rax is used for temporary storage
#
