Notes and other stuff taken while reading Programming from the Ground
Up (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pgubook/).

The book uses GNU Assembler, and the programs are in 32-bit x86 asm in
the AT&T assembly syntax. Available instructions can be found in the
Intel dev manual in Chapter 3.2. Available registers can be found in
Chapter 3.4.
