Notes and other stuff taken while reading Programming from the Ground
Up (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pgubook/).

The book uses GNU Assembler, and the programs are in 32-bit x86 asm in
the AT&T assembly syntax.

The GNU Assembler manual is available at
https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/index.html#SEC_Contents. Info
about register references, memory references and other i386 specific
things can be found at
https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/i386_002dDependent.html#i386_002dDependent.

Available instructions can be found in the Intel dev manual in Chapter
3.2. Available registers can be found in Chapter 3.4.

oflag values (e.g. O_RDONLY) can be found at
/usr/include/asm-generic/fcntl.h on my machine.
